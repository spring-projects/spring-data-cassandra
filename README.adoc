= Spring Data for Apache Cassandra image:https://jenkins.spring.io/buildStatus/icon?job=spring-data-cassandra%2Fmain&subject=Build[link=https://jenkins.spring.io/view/SpringData/job/spring-data-cassandra/] https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data[image:https://badges.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data.svg[Gitter]] image:https://img.shields.io/badge/Revved%20up%20by-Develocity-06A0CE?logo=Gradle&labelColor=02303A["Revved up by Develocity", link="https://ge.spring.io/scans?search.rootProjectNames=Spring Data for Apache Cassandra"]

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

The Apache Cassandra NoSQL Database offers many new capabilities for teams seeking a solution to handle high velocity, high volume and variable data flows.
This new way of thinking introduces new concepts and a learning curve that can be intimidating to team members and team managers. Spring Data for Apache Cassandra offers a familiar interface to those who have used other Spring Data modules in the past.

The learning curve for developing applications with Apache Cassandra is significantly reduced when using Spring Data for Apache Cassandra.
With the power to stay at a high level with annotated POJOs, or at a low level with high performance data ingestion capabilities, the Spring Data for Apache Cassandra templates are sure to meet every application need.

== Features

* Build repositories based on common Spring Data interfaces
* Support for synchronous, reactive, and asynchronous data operations
* Support for XML based Keyspace creation and CQL Table creation
* JavaConfig and XML Support for all Cluster and Session Capabilities
* Exception Translation to the familiar Spring DataAccessException hierarchy
* Convenient QueryBuilders to eliminate the need to learn CQL
* Automatic implementation of Repository interfaces including support for custom query methods
* Based on the 4.x DataStax CQL Java Driver

== Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the https://github.com/spring-projects/.github/blob/e3cc2ff230d8f1dca06535aa6b5a4a23815861d4/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[Spring Code of Conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code of conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Getting Started

Here is a quick teaser of an application using Spring Data Repositories in Java:

[source,java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);

  List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(String firstname);
}

@Service
public class MyService {

  private final PersonRepository repository;

  public MyService(PersonRepository repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  public void doWork() {

    repository.deleteAll();

    Person person = new Person();
    person.setFirstname("Matthew");
    person.setLastname("Adams");
    repository.save(person);

    List<Person> lastNameResults = repository.findByLastname("Adams");
    List<Person> firstNameResults = repository.findByFirstnameLike("M*");
 }
}

@Configuration
@EnableCassandraRepositories
class ApplicationConfig extends AbstractCassandraConfiguration {

  @Override
  public String getContactPoints() {
    return "localhost";
  }

  @Override
  protected String getKeyspaceName() {
    return "springdata";
  }
}
----

=== Maven configuration

Add the Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-cassandra</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
----

If you'd rather like the latest snapshots of the upcoming major version, use our Maven snapshot repository and declare the appropriate dependency version.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-cassandra</artifactId>
  <version>${version}-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>spring-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>
</repository>
----

== Getting Help

Having trouble with Spring Data? We’d love to help!

* Check the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/cassandra/docs/current/reference/html/[reference documentation], and https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/cassandra/docs/current/api/[Javadocs].
* Learn the Spring basics – Spring Data builds on Spring Framework, check the https://spring.io[spring.io] web-site for a wealth of reference documentation.
If you are just starting out with Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].
* Ask a question - we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-data[`spring-data-cassandra`].
You can also chat with the community on https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data[Gitter].
* Report bugs with Spring Data for Apache Cassandra at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-cassandra/issues[github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-cassandra/issues].

== Reporting Issues

Spring Data uses GitHub as issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-cassandra/issues[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue does not already exist, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-cassandra/issues/new[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Spring Data that you are using and JVM version.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use Markdown +++```+++ escapes before and after your text.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. Attach a link to your code or a compressed file containing your code.

== Building from Source

You don’t need to build from source to use Spring Data (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper].
You also need JDK 17.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.8.0 or above].

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests, and in particular please sign the https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor’s Agreement] before your first non-trivial change._

== Initial Contributors

Spring Data for Apache Cassandra was initially created and supported by the following companies and individuals:

* http://www.prowaveconsulting.com[Prowave Consulting] - David Webb

* John McPeek

=== Building reference documentation

Building the documentation builds also the project without running tests.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install -Pantora
----

The generated documentation is available from `spring-data-cassandra-distribution/antora/site/index.html`.
