/**
 * Batch operations for insert/update/delete actions on a table. {@link CassandraBatchOperations} use logged Cassandra
 * {@code BATCH}es for single entities, collections of entities, and {@link BatchableStatement statements}. A
 * {@link CassandraBatchOperations} instance cannot be modified/used once it was executed.
 * <p>
 * Batches are atomic by default. In the context of a Cassandra batch operation, atomic means that if any of the batch
 * succeeds, all of it will. Statement order does not matter within a batch. {@link CassandraBatchOperations} applies
 * all rows using the same {@link #withTimestamp(long) timestamp} if supplied, otherwise Cassandra will generate a
 * timestamp.
 * <p>
 * Multi partition batches should only be used to achieve atomicity for a few writes on different tables. Apart from
 * this they should be avoided because theyâ€™re too expensive. Single partition batches can be used to get atomicity and
 * isolation, they're not much more expensive than normal writes.
