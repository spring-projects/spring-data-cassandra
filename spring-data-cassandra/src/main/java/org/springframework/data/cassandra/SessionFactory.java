/**
 * A factory for Apache Cassandra {@link Session sessions}.
 *
 * A {@link SessionFactory} object is the preferred means of getting a connection. The {@link SessionFactory} interface
 * is implemented by a {@link CqlSession} provider.
 *
 * A {@link SessionFactory} object can have properties that can be modified when necessary. For example, if the
 * {@link CqlSession} is moved to a different server, the property for the server can be changed. The benefit is that
 * because the data source's properties can be changed, any code accessing that {@link SessionFactory} does not need to
 * be changed.
