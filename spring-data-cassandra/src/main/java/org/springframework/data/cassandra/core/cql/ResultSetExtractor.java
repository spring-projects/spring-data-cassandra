/**
 * Callback interface used by {@link CqlTemplate}'s query methods. Implementations of this interface perform the actual
 * work of extracting results from a {@link ResultSet}, but don't need to worry about exception handling.
 * {@link DriverException}s will be caught and handled by the calling {@link CqlTemplate}.
 * <p>
 * This interface is mainly used within the CQL framework itself. A {@link RowMapper} is usually a simpler choice for
 * {@link ResultSet} processing, mapping one result object per row instead of one result object for the entire
 * {@link ResultSet}.
 * <p>
 * Note: In contrast to a {@link RowCallbackHandler}, a {@link ResultSetExtractor} object is typically stateless and
 * thus reusable, as long as it doesn't access stateful resources or keep result state within the object.
