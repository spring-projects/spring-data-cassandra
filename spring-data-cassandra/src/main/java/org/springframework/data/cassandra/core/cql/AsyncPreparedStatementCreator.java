 * One of the two central callback interfaces used by the {@link AsyncCqlTemplate} class. This interface prepares a CQL

 * class.
 * <p>
 * Implementations may either create new prepared statements or reuse cached instances. Implementations do not need to
 * concern themselves with {@link DriverException}s that may be thrown from operations they attempt. The
 * {@link AsyncCqlTemplate} class will catch and handle {@link DriverException}s appropriately.
 * <p>
 * Classes implementing this interface should also implement the {@link CqlProvider} interface if it is able to provide
 * the CQL it uses for {@link PreparedStatement} creation. This allows for better contextual information in case of
 * exceptions.
