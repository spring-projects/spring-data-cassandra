/**
 * Callback interface used by {@link ReactiveCqlTemplate}'s query methods. Implementations of this interface perform the
 * actual work of extracting results from a {@link ReactiveResultSet}, but don't need to worry about exception handling.
 * {@link DriverException}s will be caught and handled by the calling {@link ReactiveCqlTemplate}.
 * <p>
 * This interface is mainly used within the CQL framework itself. A {@link RowMapper} is usually a simpler choice for
 * {@link ReactiveResultSet} processing, mapping one result object per row instead of one result object for the entire
 * {@link ReactiveResultSet}.
 * <p>
 * Note: {@link ReactiveResultSetExtractor} object is typically stateless and thus reusable, as long as it doesn't
 * access stateful resources or keep result state within the object.
