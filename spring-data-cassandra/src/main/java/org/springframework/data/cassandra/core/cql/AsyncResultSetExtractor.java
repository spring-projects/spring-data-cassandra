 * Callback interface used by {@link AsyncCqlTemplate}'s query methods. Implementations of this interface perform the
 * actual work of extracting results from a {@link AsyncResultSet}, but don't need to worry about exception handling.
 * {@link DriverException}s will be caught and handled by the calling {@link AsyncCqlTemplate}.
 * <p>
 * This interface is mainly used within the CQL framework itself. A {@link RowMapper} is usually a simpler choice for
 * {@link AsyncResultSet} processing, mapping one result object per row instead of one result object for the entire
 * {@link AsyncResultSet}.
 * <p>
 * Note: In contrast to a {@link RowCallbackHandler}, a {@link AsyncResultSetExtractor} object is typically stateless
 * and thus reusable, as long as it doesn't access stateful resources or keep result state within the object.
