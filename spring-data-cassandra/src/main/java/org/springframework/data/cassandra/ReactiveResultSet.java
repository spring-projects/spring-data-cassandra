/**
 * The reactive result of a query.
 * <p>
 * The retrieval of the rows of a {@link ReactiveResultSet} is generally paged (a first page of result is fetched and
 * the next one is only fetched once all the results of the first one has been consumed). The size of the pages can be
 * configured either globally or per-statement with
 * {@link com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.cql.SimpleStatement#setPageSize(int)}.
 * <p>
 * Please note however that this {@link ReactiveResultSet} paging is not available with the version 1 of the native
 * protocol (i.e. with Cassandra 1.2 or if version 1 has been explicitly requested). If the protocol version 1 is in
 * use, a {@link ReactiveResultSet} is always fetched in it's entirely and it's up to the client to make sure that no
 * query can yield {@link ReactiveResultSet} that won't hold in memory.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class is not thread-safe.
