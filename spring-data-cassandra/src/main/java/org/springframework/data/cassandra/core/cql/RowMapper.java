/**
 * An interface used by {@link CqlTemplate} for mapping rows of a {@link ResultSet} on a per-row basis. Implementations
 * of this interface perform the actual work of mapping each row to a result object, but don't need to worry about
 * exception handling. {@link DriverException}s will be caught and handled by the calling {@link CqlTemplate}.
 * <p>
 * Typically used either for {@link CqlTemplate}'s query methods or for out parameters of stored procedures.
 * {@link RowMapper} objects are typically stateless and thus reusable; they are an ideal choice for implementing
 * row-mapping logic in a single place.
