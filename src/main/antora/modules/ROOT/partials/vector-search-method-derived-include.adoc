interface CommentRepository extends Repository<Comment, String> {

  List<Comment> searchByEmbeddingNear(Vector vector);

  SearchResults<Comment> searchByEmbeddingNear(Vector vector, ScoringFunction function);

}

Cassandra does not allow to limit search results by their score.
You can declare a `ScoringFunction` argument to specify which scoring function to use to calculate similarity.
