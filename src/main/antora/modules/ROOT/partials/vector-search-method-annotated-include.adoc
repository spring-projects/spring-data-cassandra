.Using `@Query`

interface CommentRepository extends Repository<Comment, String> {

  @Query("""
         SELECT id, description, country, similarity_cosine(embedding,:embedding) AS score
         FROM comments
         ORDER BY embedding ANN OF :embedding LIMIT :limit

Cassandra does not allow to limit search results by their score.
Declared search methods can include a `score` projection column if you wish to return the score value.
You can declare a `ScoringFunction` argument to specify which scoring function to use to calculate similarity.
