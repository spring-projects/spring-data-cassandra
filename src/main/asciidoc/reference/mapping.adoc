= Mapping

Rich object mapping support is provided by the `MappingCassandraConverter`. `MappingCassandraConverter` has a rich metadata model that provides a complete feature set of functionality to map domain objects to CQL tables.

The mapping metadata model is populated by using annotations on your domain objects.
However, the infrastructure is not limited to using annotations as the only source of metadata.
The `MappingCassandraConverter` also lets you map domain objects to tables without providing any additional metadata, by following a set of conventions.

In this chapter, we describe the features of the `MappingCassandraConverter`, how to use conventions for mapping domain objects to tables, and how to override those conventions with annotation-based mapping metadata.

== Data Mapping and Type Conversion

This section explains how types are mapped to and from an Apache Cassandra representation.

Spring Data for Apache Cassandra supports several types that are provided by Apache Cassandra.
In addition to these types, Spring Data for Apache Cassandra provides a set of built-in converters to map additional types.
You can provide your own custom converters to adjust type conversion.
See "`<<cassandra.mapping.explicit-converters>>`" for further details.
The following table maps Spring Data types to Cassandra types:

[cols="3,2",options="header"]
.Type
|===

| `String`
| `text` (default), `varchar`, `ascii`

| `double`, `Double`
| `double`

|===

Each supported type maps to a default
https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_reference/cql_data_types_c.html[Cassandra data type].
Java types can be mapped to other Cassandra types by using `@CassandraType`, as the following example shows:

.Enum mapping to numeric types
====
[source,java]
----
@Table
public class EnumToOrdinalMapping {

  @PrimaryKey String id;

  @CassandraType(type = Name.INT) Condition asOrdinal;
}

public enum Condition {
  NEW, USED
}
----
====

[[mapping-conventions]]
== Convention-based Mapping

`MappingCassandraConverter` uses a few conventions for mapping domain objects to CQL tables when no additional mapping metadata is provided.
The conventions are:

* The simple (short) Java class name is mapped to the table name by being changed to lower case.
For example, `com.bigbank.SavingsAccount` maps to a table named `savingsaccount`.
* The converter uses any registered Spring `Converter` instances to override the default mapping of object properties to tables columns.
* The properties of an object are used to convert to and from columns in the table.

You can adjust conventions by configuring a `NamingStrategy` on `CassandraMappingContext`.
Naming strategy objects implement the convention by which a table, column or user-defined type is derived from an entity class and from an actual property.

The following example shows how to configure a `NamingStrategy`:

.Configuring `NamingStrategy` on `CassandraMappingContext`
====
[source,java]
----
include::../{example-root}/NamingStrategyConfiguration.java[tags=method]
----
====

[[mapping-configuration]]
=== Mapping Configuration

Unless explicitly configured, an instance of `MappingCassandraConverter` is created by default when creating a `CassandraTemplate`.
You can create your own instance of the `MappingCassandraConverter` to tell it where to scan the classpath at startup for your domain classes to extract metadata and construct indexes.

Also, by creating your own instance, you can register Spring `Converter` instances to use for mapping specific classes to and from the database.
The following example configuration class sets up Cassandra mapping support:

.@Configuration class to configure Cassandra mapping support
====
[source,java]
----
include::../{example-root}/SchemaConfiguration.java[tags=class]
----
====

`AbstractCassandraConfiguration` requires you to implement methods that define a keyspace.
`AbstractCassandraConfiguration` also has a method named  `getEntityBasePackages(…)`.
You can override it to tell the converter where to scan for classes annotated with the `@Table` annotation.

You can add additional converters to the `MappingCassandraConverter` by overriding the `customConversions` method.

NOTE: `AbstractCassandraConfiguration` creates a `CassandraTemplate` instance and registers it with the container under the name of `cassandraTemplate`.

[[mapping.usage]]
== Metadata-based Mapping

To take full advantage of the object mapping functionality inside the Spring Data for Apache Cassandra support, you should annotate your mapped domain objects with the `@Table` annotation.
Doing so lets the classpath scanner find and pre-process your domain objects to extract the necessary metadata.
Only annotated entities are used to perform schema actions.
In the worst case, a `SchemaAction.RECREATE_DROP_UNUSED` operation drops your tables and you lose your data.
The following example shows a simple domain object:

.Example domain object
====
[source,java]
----
package com.mycompany.domain;

@Table
public class Person {

  @Id
  private String id;

  @CassandraType(type = Name.VARINT)
  private Integer ssn;

  private String firstName;

  private String lastName;
}
----
====

IMPORTANT: The `@Id` annotation tells the mapper which property you want to use for the Cassandra primary key.
Composite primary keys can require a slightly different data model.

[[cassandra-template.id-handling]]
=== Working with Primary Keys

Cassandra requires at least one partition key field for a CQL table.
A table can additionally declare one or more clustering key fields.
When your CQL table has a composite primary key, you must create a `@PrimaryKeyClass` to define the structure of the composite primary key.
In this context, "`composite primary key`" means one or more partition columns optionally combined with one or more clustering columns.

Primary keys can make use of any singular simple Cassandra type or mapped user-defined Type.
Collection-typed primary keys are not supported.

==== Simple Primary Keys

A simple primary key consists of one partition key field within an entity class.
Since it is one field only, we safely can assume it is a partition key.
The following listing shows a CQL table defined in Cassandra with a primary key of `user_id`:

.CQL Table defined in Cassandra
====
[source]
----
CREATE TABLE user (
  user_id text,
  firstname text,
  lastname text,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id))
;
----
====

The following example shows a Java class annotated such that it corresponds to the Cassandra defined in the previous listing:

.Annotated Entity
====
[source,java]
----
@Table(value = "login_event")
public class LoginEvent {

  @PrimaryKey("user_id")
  private String userId;

  private String firstname;
  private String lastname;

  // getters and setters omitted

}
----
====

==== Composite Keys

Composite primary keys (or compound keys) consist of more than one primary key field.
That said, a composite primary key can consist of multiple partition keys, a partition key and a clustering key, or a multitude of primary key fields.

Composite keys can be represented in two ways with Spring Data for Apache Cassandra:

* Embedded in an entity.
* By using `@PrimaryKeyClass`.

The simplest form of a composite key is a key with one partition key and one clustering key.

The following example shows a CQL statement to represent the table and its composite key:

.CQL Table with a Composite Primary Key
====
[source]
----
CREATE TABLE login_event(
  person_id text,
  event_code int,
  event_time timestamp,
  ip_address text,
  PRIMARY KEY (person_id, event_code, event_time))
  WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (event_time DESC)
;
----
====

==== Flat Composite Primary Keys

Flat composite primary keys are embedded inside the entity as flat fields.
Primary key fields are annotated with
`@PrimaryKeyColumn`.
Selection requires either a query to contain predicates for the individual fields or the use of `MapId`.
The following example shows a class with a flat composite primary key:

.Using a flat composite primary key
====
[source,java]
----
include::../{example-root}/LoginEvent.java[tags=class]
----
====

==== Primary Key Class

A primary key class is a composite primary key class that is mapped to multiple fields or properties of the entity.
It is annotated with `@PrimaryKeyClass` and should define `equals` and `hashCode` methods.
The semantics of value equality for these methods should be consistent with the database equality for the database types to which the key is mapped.
Primary key classes can be used with repositories (as the `Id` type) and to represent an entity's identity in a single complex object.
The following example shows a composite primary key class:

.Composite primary key class
====
[source,java]
----
include::../{example-root}/LoginEventKey.java[tags=class]
----
====

The following example shows how to use a composite primary key:

.Using a composite primary key
====
[source,java]
----
@Table(value = "login_event")
public class LoginEvent {

  @PrimaryKey
  private LoginEventKey key;

  @Column("ip_address")
  private String ipAddress;

  // getters and setters omitted
}
----
====

[[mapping.embedded-entities]]
=== Embedded Entity Support

Embedded entities are used to design value objects in your Java domain model whose properties are flattened out into the table.
In the following example you see, that `User.name` is annotated with `@Embedded`.
The consequence of this is that all properties of `UserName` are folded into the `user` table which consists of 3 columns (`user_id`, `firstname`, `lastname`).

[NOTE]
====
Embedded entities may only contain simple property types.
It is not possible to nest an embedded entity into another embedded one.
====

However, if the `firstname` and `lastname` column values are actually `null` within the result set, the entire property `name` will be set to `null` according to the `onEmpty` of `@Embedded`, which ``null``s objects when all nested properties are `null`. +
Opposite to this behavior `USE_EMPTY` tries to create a new instance using either a default constructor or one that accepts nullable parameter values from the result set.

.Sample Code of embedding objects
====
[source,java]
----
public class User {

	@PrimaryKey("user_id")
    private String userId;

    @Embedded(onEmpty = USE_NULL) <1>
    UserName name;
}

public class UserName {
    private String firstname;
    private String lastname;
}
----
<1> Property is `null` if `firstname` and `lastname` are `null`.
Use `onEmpty=USE_EMPTY` to instantiate `UserName` with a potential `null` value for its properties.
====

You can embed a value object multiple times in an entity by using the optional `prefix` element of the `@Embedded` annotation.
This element represents a prefix and is prepended to each column name in the embedded object.
Note that properties will overwrite each other if multiple properties render to the same column name.

[TIP]
====
Make use of the shortcuts `@Embedded.Nullable` and `@Embedded.Empty` for `@Embedded(onEmpty = USE_NULL)` and `@Embedded(onEmpty = USE_EMPTY)` to reduce verbosity and simultaneously set JSR-305 `@javax.annotation.Nonnull` accordingly.

[source,java]
----
public class MyEntity {

    @Id
    Integer id;

    @Embedded.Nullable <1>
    EmbeddedEntity embeddedEntity;
}
----
<1> Shortcut for `@Embedded(onEmpty = USE_NULL)`.

[[mapping.usage-annotations]]
=== Mapping Annotation Overview

The `MappingCassandraConverter` can use metadata to drive the mapping of objects to rows in a Cassandra table.
An overview of the annotations follows:

* `@Id`: Applied at the field or property level to mark the property used for identity purposes.
* `@Table`: Applied at the class level to indicate that this class is a candidate for mapping to the database.
You can specify the name of the table where the object is stored.
* `@PrimaryKey`: Similar to `@Id` but lets you specify the column name.
* `@PrimaryKeyColumn`: Cassandra-specific annotation for primary key columns that lets you specify primary key column attributes, such as for clustered or partitioned.
Can be used on single and multiple attributes to indicate either a single or a composite (compound) primary key.
If used on a property within the entity, make sure to apply the `@Id` annotation as well.
* `@PrimaryKeyClass`: Applied at the class level to indicate that this class is a compound primary key class.
Must be referenced with `@PrimaryKey` in the entity class.
* `@Transient`: By default, all private fields are mapped to the row.
This annotation excludes the field where it is applied from being stored in the database.
Transient properties cannot be used within a persistence constructor as the converter cannot materialize a value for the constructor argument.
* `@PersistenceConstructor`: Marks a given constructor -- even a package protected one -- to use when instantiating the object from the database.
Constructor arguments are mapped by name to the key values in the retrieved row.
* `@Value`: This annotation is part of the Spring Framework . Within the mapping framework it can be applied to constructor arguments.
This lets you use a Spring Expression Language statement to transform a key's value retrieved in the database before it is used to construct a domain object.
In order to reference a property of a given `Row`/`UdtValue`/`TupleValue` one has to use expressions like: `@Value("#root.getString(0)")` where `root` refers to the root of the given document.
* `@ReadOnlyProperty`: Applies at the field level to mark a property as read-only.
Entity-bound insert and update statements do not include this property.
* `@Column`: Applied at the field level.
Describes the column name as it is represented in the Cassandra table, thus letting the name differ from the field name of the class.
Can be used on constructor arguments to customize the column name during constructor creation.
* `@Embedded`: Applied at the field level.
Enables embedded object usage for types mapped to a table or a user-defined type.
Properties of the embedded object are flattened into the structure of its parent.
* `@Indexed`: Applied at the field level.
Describes the index to be created at session initialization.
* `@SASI`: Applied at the field level.
Allows SASI index creation during session initialization.
* `@CassandraType`: Applied at the field level to specify a Cassandra data type.
Types are derived from the property declaration by default.
* `@Frozen`: Applied at the field level to class-types and parametrized types.
Declares a frozen UDT column or frozen collection like `List<@Frozen UserDefinedPersonType>`.
* `@UserDefinedType`: Applied at the type level to specify a Cassandra User-defined Data Type (UDT).
Types are derived from the declaration by default.
* `@Tuple`: Applied at the type level to use a type as a mapped tuple.
* `@Element`: Applied at the field level to specify element or field ordinals within a mapped tuple.
Types are derived from the property declaration by default.
Can be used on constructor arguments to customize tuple element ordinals during constructor creation.
* `@Version`: Applied at field level is used for optimistic locking and checked for modification on save operations.
The initial value is `zero` which is bumped automatically on every update.

The mapping metadata infrastructure is defined in the separate, spring-data-commons project that is both technology- and data store-agnostic.

The following example shows a more complex mapping:

.Mapped `Person` class
====
[source,java]
----
include::../{example-root}/mapping/Person.java[tags=class]
----
====

The following example shows how to map a UDT `Address`:

.Mapped User-Defined Type `Address`
====
[source,java]
----
include::../{example-root}/mapping/Address.java[tags=class]
----
====

NOTE: Working with User-Defined Types requires a `UserTypeResolver` that is configured with the mapping context.
See the <<cassandra.connectors,configuration chapter>> for how to configure a `UserTypeResolver`.

The following example shows how map a tuple:

.Mapped Tuple
====
[source,java]
----
include::../{example-root}/mapping/Coordinates.java[tags=class]
----
====

[[mapping.index-creation]]
==== Index Creation

You can annotate particular entity properties with `@Indexed` or `@SASI` if you wish to create secondary indexes on application startup.
Index creation creates simple secondary indexes for scalar types, user-defined types, and collection types.

You can configure a SASI Index to apply an analyzer, such as `StandardAnalyzer` or `NonTokenizingAnalyzer` (by using
`@StandardAnalyzed` and `@NonTokenizingAnalyzed`, respectively).

Map types distinguish between `ENTRY`, `KEYS`, and `VALUES` indexes.
Index creation derives the index type from the annotated element.
The following example shows a number of ways to create an index:

.Variants of map indexing
====
[source,java]
----
include::../{example-root}/mapping/PersonWithIndexes.java[tags=class]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The `@Indexed` annotation can be applied to single properties of embedded entities or along side with the `@Embedded` annotation, in which case all properties of the embedded are indexed.
====

CAUTION: Index creation on session initialization may have a severe performance impact on application startup.

include::./converters.adoc[]

include::../{spring-data-commons-docs}/is-new-state-detection.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

NOTE: Cassandra provides no means to generate identifiers upon inserting data.
As consequence, entities must be associated with identifier values.
Spring Data defaults to identifier inspection to determine whether an entity is new.
If you want to use <<cassandra.auditing,auditing>> make sure to either use <<cassandra.template.optimistic-locking>> or implement `Persistable` for proper entity state detection.

[[cassandra.mapping-usage.events]]
== Lifecycle Events

The Cassandra mapping framework has several built-in `org.springframework.context.ApplicationEvent` events that your application can respond to by registering special beans in the `ApplicationContext`.
Being based on Spring's application context event infrastructure lets other products, such as Spring Integration, easily receive these events as they are a well known eventing mechanism in Spring-based applications.

To intercept an object before it goes into the database, you can register a subclass of `org.springframework.data.cassandra.core.mapping.event.AbstractCassandraEventListener` that overrides the `onBeforeSave(…)` method.
When the event is dispatched, your listener is called and passed the domain object (which is a Java entity).
Entity lifecycle events can be costly and you may notice a change in the performance profile when loading large result sets.
You can disable lifecycle events on the Template API object.
The following example uses the `onBeforeSave` method:

====
[source,java]
----
include::../{example-root}/mapping/BeforeSaveListener.java[tags=class]
----
====

Declaring these beans in your Spring `ApplicationContext` will cause them to be invoked whenever the event is dispatched.

The `AbstractCassandraEventListener` has the following callback methods:

* `onBeforeSave`: Called in `CassandraTemplate.insert(…)` and `.update(…)` operations before inserting or updating a row in the database.
* `onAfterSave`: Called in `CassandraTemplate…insert(…)` and `.update(…)` operations after inserting or updating a row in the database.
* `onBeforeDelete`: Called in `CassandraTemplate.delete(…)` operations before deleting row from the database.
* `onAfterDelete`: Called in `CassandraTemplate.delete(…)` operations after deleting row from the database.
* `onAfterLoad`: Called in the `CassandraTemplate.select(…)`, `.slice(…)`, and `.stream(…)` methods after each row is retrieved from the database.
* `onAfterConvert`: Called in the `CassandraTemplate.select(…)`, `.slice(…)`, and `.stream(…)` methods after converting a row retrieved from the database to a POJO.

NOTE: Lifecycle events are emitted only for root-level types.
Complex types used as properties within an aggregate root are not subject to event publication.
