= Preface

The Spring Data for Apache Cassandra project applies core Spring concepts to the development of solutions using
the Cassandra Columnar data store.  A "template" is provided as a high-level abstraction for storing
and querying documents. You will notice similarities to the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#jdbc[JDBC support]
in the core Spring Framework.
